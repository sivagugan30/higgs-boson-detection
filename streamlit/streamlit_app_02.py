    The Higgs Boson, often called the "God Particle," is a fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field.
    It explains why other particles have mass.

    Discovered in 2012 at CERN, the Higgs Boson confirmed a missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics.
    It's not magical â€” but without it, the universe wouldn't have formed the way it did.
